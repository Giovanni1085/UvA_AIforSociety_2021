## Set-up

### Editor

You will need an **editor** to write code and edit files. If you don't have a preferred one yet, check [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).

### Working with Jupyter Notebooks

* Option 0 (fallback): Use [Binder](https://mybinder.org) (link above). Keep in mind you need to download your notebooks to save them locally.

* Option 1 (recommended): Download [the repository contents](https://github.com/Giovanni1085/UvA_CDH_2020) and use [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) or the Jyputer Notebook. See this [guide to setup your environment](https://github.com/Giovanni1085/UvA_CDH_2020/blob/master/setup.md) for more info.

* Option 2 (advanced): work directly with git and conda. See this [guide to setup your environment](https://github.com/Giovanni1085/UvA_CDH_2020/blob/master/setup.md) for more info.
